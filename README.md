# eDNA-protocols
Protocols for sampling, processing, and analysis of eDNA collected on CalCOFI cruises as part of the [West Coast OBON](https://evsatt.github.io/WC-OBON_Website/) sampling effort. All protocols are formatted according to guidelines from Better Biomolecular Ocean Practices (BeBOP) using [Minimum Information about an Omics Protocol (MIOP)](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON/miop/tree/main) and FAIR eDNA (FAIRe) terms.

## Sample collection
